Which problem statement do you want to solve around the communication as a broader theme? (Max 150 words)
Your answer - We want to create a Chatbot for Students. This Chatbot is going to be like a friend for all the students who are shy and hesitate in the class to ask any question to the teacher. As sometimes students feel bored reading the whole class summary PDF, with this chatbot they can ask for any specific syntax or logic behind the code. This particular Chatbot is going to be targeted towards the students and the issues they are facing outside the class.
The problem statement that we want to solve around communication is by creating a chatbot for students. At present the WhitehatJrâ€™s student dashboard  is such that they are unable to clear doubts outside class hours. This doubt clearance chatbot is also going to be like a friend even to those students who are shy and hesitant to ask questions to the teacher during class. Since teachers are not available 24/7 to clear students' doubts and also sometimes the students feel it's time consuming to read the entire class summary PDF, this chatbot will be one of the biggest assets any student can have on his/her dashboard and which will be available with just a click away!
